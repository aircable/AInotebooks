version are expected to have smaller sizes due to reduced precision. However, in your case, the INT8 model is larger. This anomaly might result from additional overhead introduced during the quantization process or specific model architecture characteristics.​\n","\n","- The TFLite INT8 model demonstrates the fastest inference time, aligning with expectations that lower-precision models execute computations more swiftly. The PyTorch model exhibits the slowest inference, which is consistent with observations that TensorFlow Lite often outperforms PyTorch in mobile environments due to its optimized architecture.\n","\n","- The output consistency, as measured by standard deviation, indicates variability in model predictions. The PyTorch and TFLite Float32 models show some variability, while the TFLite INT8 model exhibits no variability (standard deviation of 0.0). This could suggest that the INT8 model is producing uniform outputs, potentially indicating a loss of sensitivity or dynamic range due to quantization. Such issues have been reported where INT8 quantization leads to degraded performance or incorrect confidence scores"]}],"metadata":{"jupytext":{"cell_metadata_filter":"-all","main_language":"python","notebook_metadata_filter":"-all"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"llm","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.16"},"colab":{"provenance":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
